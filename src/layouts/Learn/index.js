                        <h2>The Serverless Movement</h2>
                        <p>Serverless has become a movement about developer empowerment. As a technology, it abstracts away the most menial parts of building an application, leaving you free to actually spend your days coding.</p>

                        <p>What this means is that you, the developer, can rapidly build apps that handle production-ready traffic. You don’t have to actively manage scaling for your applications. You don't have to provision servers, or pay for resources that go unused.</p>
                        <p>The technology is still early, but thousands of developers are already proving that serverless can enable them to launch applications at record speed and cost.</p>

                      <p>The serverless movement started with the release of AWS Lambda, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute service. But serverless is much more than just FaaS.</p>
                      <p>Ultimately, serverless is about focusing your efforts on what provides value to your users. This means using managed services for databases, search indexes, queues, SMS messaging, and email delivery. It means tying these services together using stateless, ephemeral compute like the various FaaS offerings.</p>
                      <p>Upgrading your Linux distro does not provide value to your users. Managing your RabbitMQ servers does not provide value to your users. Shipping product provides value to your users.</p>

                        <p>Deploy code without provisioning anything beforehand, or managing anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system. No more bothering the Ops department.</p>

                        <p>Let your service providers manage the scaling challenges. No need to fire alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. Handle quick bursts of traffic and weekend lulls the same way -- with peace of mind.</p>

                        <p>Function-as-a-service compute and managed services charged based on usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. You can have complete resource utilization without paying a cent for idle time. The results? 90% cost-savings over a cloud VM, and the satisfaction of knowing that you never pay for resources you don’t use.</p>

                        <p>Shorten the loop between having an idea and deploying to production. Because there's less to provision up front and less to manage after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It's easier than ever to make your idea live.</p>

                      <p>If the Serverless Application is the new and improved application house on the block, then the Serverless Framework is the door you use to enter that house.</p>
                      <p>Serverless Applications are the next step in cloud-native development, and they require automation. If you're tying together multiple managed services and functions, you cannot rely on a checklist of manual steps. You should be able to recreate your entire application with a command.</p>
                      <p>That is where the Serverless Framework comes in. Use the Serverless Framework CLI to build and deploy your application to any and every cloud provider with a consistent experience. The Framework automatically configures cloud vendor settings for you, based on the language you use and the cloud provider you deploy to.</p>
                      <p>Keeping a maniacal focus on business value applies to your development tooling as well. Kids, don't roll your own deployment tools.</p>

                        <p>The Serverless Framework CLI enables developers to build, test, and deploy all in the same environment. Developers write their functions in cloud-agnostic Serverless YAML, and services can be deployed with a single command. Transactionally deploy code to multiple providers, version your deployments, and roll back the deployment if necessary.</p>
